# Quantium’s retail analytics

## 1. Defining the Question

The Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behavior within the region. The insights from this analysis will be fed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

### a) Main Tasks

* Examining transaction data – looking for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. If we determine any anomalies, we make the necessary changes in the dataset and save it. Having clean data will help when it comes to your analysis. 

* Examining customer data – check for similar issues in the customer data, looking for nulls and merging the transaction and customer data together so it’s ready for the analysis ensuring you save your files along the way.

* Data analysis and customer segments – making sure we define the metrics – look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find. These will all form part of our report. 

* Deep dive into customer segments – defining the recommendation from your insights, determine which segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on your analysis.
